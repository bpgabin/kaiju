K.A.I.J.U.
=======
K.A.I.J.U. is a 3D QWOP-like game where the player must take control of either the valiant ATLAS robot defender or the attacking monster. The game was ambitiously created by a group of four students in a Game Design Practicum course using Unity 4 and attempting a 3D game for the first time.

The game can be played on Kongregate here: http://www.kongregate.com/games/Caereus/k-a-i-j-u
